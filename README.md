# TTS MTG Image Bank
This repo contains images for tts booster pack generation, including all booster images as well as non-scryfall sourced card images. It also will eventually contain the ruby and json used for pack creation.

This repo contains a lot of card images from a wide variety of custom card creators across the custom MTG scene. They're stashed here so I have a consolidated hosting place to generate boosters for TTS - no insult or claim to those works is intended. (This also goes for official stuff, but I'm not worried about potentially hurting the feelings of or upsetting a billion dollar corporation owned by a bigger, billion-dier dollar corporation.)
